This is an attempt to study the variation of symbol error rate with SNR (noise power in the simulation) for M-QAM in the presence of AWGN. A comparison of the theoretical and simulated error curves is also made to verify the theoretically obtained symbol error rate and the behaviour of the curves as M varies is noted.
